      <h1>"The Story" by <i>Thirty Seconds To Mars</i></h1>

      <div class="main-block">
        <pre>
                I've been thinking of everything
                I used to want to be
                I've been thinking of everything
                Of me, of you and me
          
                This is the story of my life
                These are the lies I have created
                These are the lies I have created
              
                I'm in the middle of nothing
                And it's where I want to be
                Why at the bottom of everything
                I finally start to believe
           
 
                This is the story of my life
                These are the lies I have created
                These are the lies I have created
                I created.
            
                And I swear to God
                I'll find myself
                In the end
                In the end
                In the end
                In the end
               
                In the end
                In the end
                In the end
                In the end
                This is the story of my life
                These are the lies I have created
                These are the lies I have created
                These are the lies I have created
                These are the lies I have created
                </pre
